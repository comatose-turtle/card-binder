# Card Binder

A simple sample project to display a set of cards stored in Supabase. Made to display a user's owned cards as well as the "whole set". User authentication is adaptable, as only the user's id as stored in the database when associated with their inventory is relevant.

Does NOT handle acquisition of new cards or any database editing. Display only.
